Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is the code that is used to add Style to the website making it more presentable.
Styling in CSS involves changing the property of the selected tag. Properties include things like backgroung-color, Font-family, color, border, margin and padding etc.
Each property changes something about the element selected. For example you can change the text color of the <p> tag to red by changing its "color" property to red.
You can write css code directly in the Html file or create a seperate css file and link it to the html file using the link tag. It should look something like this "<link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />" where the "href" attribute defines the location of the css file.
You can change multiple Properties by seperating them with a semi-colon. this help the browser seperate the property-values of one from another property.
You can also apply the same styles for different selectors by seperating them with a coma.
Each tag can be reprisented as a box which has various css properties that can be manipulated, these are cales the box model.
The margin and padding property are common attribute of the box model that help manage spacing within and outside the box.
Maargin defines the space that should be observed outside the box and Padding defines the space that should be seen within the box.
The border property is also among them and helps show the border line of the container.
Also properties like width and heigth help set the size of the box. A good example would be when styling an image. You can set the width and heigth of the image to fit into the desired view.
